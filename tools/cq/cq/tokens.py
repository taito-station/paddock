"""Token counting for cq (NFR-CQ-01).

`tiktoken` is imported lazily and only once: the search path must not pay for
it at import time. When it is unavailable the character heuristic is used and
the caller can report which counter produced the numbers, so that measurements
are never presented as exact when they are not.
