"""Vector store for the semantic route, kept beside the main index (FR-CQ-17).

The vectors live in their own SQLite file rather than in ``chunks``: adding a
column would bump ``store.SCHEMA_VERSION``, and ``store.open_store`` rejects a
mismatched database fail-closed. That would force every user to rebuild the
whole index (106 s for the hve profile) for a feature that is off by default.

The cost of that separation is drift. ``chunks.chunk_id`` is derived from the
path and the chunk index, not from the content, so a stale row keeps its id
after an edit. Each row therefore carries the SHA-1 of the *file* it came from
(``files.sha1``), which the query side compares against the live index -- 830
rows for the hve profile, cheap enough to check on every search. Rows whose file
changed are treated as absent, degrading the semantic route to "fewer
candidates" instead of "wrong answers".
