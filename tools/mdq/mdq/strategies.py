"""Markdown chunking strategies for the markdown-query Skill.

Each (language, strategy) combination is materialised into a separate SQLite
DB under ``.mdq/index-<lang>-<strategy>.sqlite`` (see :func:`mdq.store.db_path_for`).
The ``lang`` axis governs **two** things: (1) the per-language DB file
separation (so a single physical store is queried with a single tokenizer),
and (2) the FTS5 tokenizer choice in :mod:`mdq.tokenize` (``trigram``
for ``ja-jp`` when available; ``unicode61`` otherwise). The chunking
algorithm itself does not depend on ``lang``.

Available strategies (see ``users-guide/skills-markdown-query.md``):

- ``heading`` (default, legacy): heading-bounded chunks via
  :func:`mdq.indexer.scan_file` with ``max_chunk_chars=0``.
- ``heading_recursive``: heading-bounded chunks, then any chunk exceeding
  :data:`HEADING_RECURSIVE_MAX_CHARS` is subdivided via the existing
  paragraph/line/fence-aware splitter (``_subdivide``).
- ``fixed_window``: ignores heading structure, splits the whole file body
  into fixed-size overlapping windows (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter-style).
- ``semantic_paragraph``: heading-bounded chunks subdivided by embedding
  similarity breakpoints (Kamradt-modified). Requires the ``[semantic]``
  extra; falls back to ``heading_recursive`` if embeddings are unavailable.
- ``pageindex``: heading-bounded chunks (same boundaries as ``heading``)
  plus a per-chunk ``summary`` field computed from the chunk body
  (head N chars or first paragraph). LLM-free; stored in ``chunks.summary``
  (SCHEMA v6). Designed for PageIndex-style table-of-contents navigation.

Future: ``sentence`` (proposition-level) is reserved for Phase 3.
